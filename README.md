## Objective:
Create a DJ system with OSC Controller (Open Sound Control) and PureData (PD) language.

## Explanation of the problem:
Based on the platforms to make a DJ system, it should be noted that most of the app widgets (sliders and buttons) should be used, where each interaction in a widget must have an auditory response in PD, so that electronic music pieces can be created in the style of a DJ, to later upload a demo to YouTube where you can see what the system can do, exemplifying a DJ-style song that does not last more than 5 minutes.

## Proposed Solution:
To Complete.

## Conclusion:
To Complete.

### Video
To Complete.
