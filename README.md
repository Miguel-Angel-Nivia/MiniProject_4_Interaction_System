## Objective:
Create a DJ system with OSC Controller (Open Sound Control) and PureData (PD) language.

## Explanation of the problem:
Based on the platforms to make a DJ system, it should be noted that most of the app widgets (sliders and buttons) should be used, where each interaction in a widget must have an auditory response in PD, so that electronic music pieces can be created in the style of a DJ, to later upload a demo to YouTube where you can see what the system can do, exemplifying a DJ-style song that does not last more than 5 minutes.

## Proposed Solution:
to carry out the work we first thought about looking for how a DJ system similar to a synthesizer looks and is physically used, after this by having 4 OSC controller pages we divided them into important functions, the first to play the main music with modification of rhythms, backgrounds and volumes, for the second page, a filter for the human voice to convert it to a more robotic one, to use it on page 3 where these same ones are recorded and can be played in a loop to give some personalized rhythm, and on the last page with 12 buttons we added 4 infinite sounds and 8 that are like a keyboard, to listen to different rhythms and play with all this to make the music for the video.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I think we did a good job covering what was requested in the requirements to be able to correctly create the music, relying on YouTube videos and a documentation book to be able to correctly manage the pure data application with OSC Controller.
